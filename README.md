## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Project Description
The dataset was preprocessed and analyzed to handle **missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling**. Machine learning models were then trained to predict car prices:  

- **Random Forest Regression** – **75.01% accuracy**  
- **Multiple Linear Regression** – **33.72% accuracy**  

These predictions help users make informed decisions about car purchases and pricing strategies. Random Forest Regression outperformed linear regression, indicating non-linear relationships in the dataset.
